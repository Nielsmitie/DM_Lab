The goal of this project was to replicate and extend the results obtained by the [Agnostic Feature Selection](https://www.ecmlpkdd2019.org/downloads/paper/744.pdf) paper.

# Abstract
Unsupervised feature selection is mostly assessed along a
supervised learning setting, depending on whether the selected features efficiently permit to predict the (unknown) target variable. Another setting
is proposed in this paper: the selected features aim to efficiently recover
the whole dataset. The proposed algorithm, called AgnoS, combines an
AutoEncoder with structural regularizations to sidestep the combinatorial optimization problem at the core of feature selection. The extensive
experimental validation of AgnoS on the scikit-feature benchmark suite
demonstrates its ability compared to the state of the art, both in terms
of supervised learning and data compression.
